##Real-Time Chat Application using React & Socket.io
*Project Overview*
This is a real-time chat application built using React (frontend) and Node.js with Express and Socket.io (backend). It allows users to send and receive messages instantly, showcasing the power of WebSockets for real-time communication.

The application is lightweight, easy to set up, and can be used as a foundation for building more advanced chat systems such as customer support chats, team collaboration tools, or gaming chat features.

*Features*
*Instant real-time messaging* – Messages are sent and received instantly.
*WebSocket communication* – Uses Socket.io for real-time data transfer.
*User-friendly interface* – Built with React.js for a smooth experience.
*Node.js & Express backend* – Manages WebSocket connections efficiently.
*Broadcast messaging* – Messages are visible to all connected users.
*Lightweight & scalable* – Easy to deploy and extend with additional features.

*How It Works*
The frontend (React.js) connects to the backend (Node.js) via Socket.io.
When a user sends a message, it is emitted to the backend.
The backend broadcasts the message to all connected clients.
All users receive the message in real-time without needing to refresh the page.

*Technologies Used*
*Frontend:*
React.js
Socket.io-client
HTML, CSS, JavaScript

*Backend:*
Node.js
Express.js
Socket.io
